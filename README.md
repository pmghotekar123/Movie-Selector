## Features

1. **Browse Movies:** View a list of popular movies, top-rated movies, upcoming releases, and more.

3. **Movie Details:** Click on a movie to see more details, including the synopsis, release date, and average rating.

3. **Dynamic UI:** A responsive and dynamic user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- TMDB API Key. You can obtain one by creating an account on the TMDB website.

## API Key Security Note

Ensure that you keep your TMDB API key secure. Never expose it directly in your client-side code or share it publicly. Consider using environment variables or a server to handle API requests securely.

Happy coding!
